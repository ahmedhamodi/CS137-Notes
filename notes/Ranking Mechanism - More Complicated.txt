Let x = 0.8 represent the probability of a link being pressed to travel to a new page.

r(A) = 1-0.8/3 + 0.8(r(C)/1)
     = 1/15 + 4/5*r(C)

r(B) = 1-0.8/3 + 0.8(r(A)/2)
     = 1/15 + 2/5*r(A)

r(C) = 1-0.8/3 + 0.8(r(A)/2) + 0.8(r(B)/1)
     = 1/15 + 2/5*r(A) + 4/5*r(B)

Solving this system using Gaussian Elimination or even Cramer's Rule:
r(A) = 61/159 = 0.38365...
r(B) = 35/159 = 0.22013...
r(C) = 21/53 = 0.39623...
